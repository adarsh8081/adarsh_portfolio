# üö® CRITICAL: Fix Vercel Project Settings NOW

## Current Problem:
Your build logs show Vercel is STILL building from ROOT directory, not WEB directory!

```
Running from: / (root) ‚Üê WRONG!
Should run from: /web     ‚Üê CORRECT!
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE STEPS - DO THIS NOW:

### Step 1: Open Your Vercel Project
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your project: **`adarsh_portfolio`**
3. **Click on the project name**

### Step 2: Go to Settings
1. **Click "Settings"** (top navigation bar)
2. **Click "General"** (left sidebar menu)

### Step 3: Find Root Directory Setting
1. **Scroll down** to find **"Root Directory"** section
2. You'll see a text field that currently says **`.`** (dot)

### Step 4: Change Root Directory
1. **Clear the field** (delete the `.`)
2. **Type**: `web`
3. **Click "Save"** button

### Step 5: Verify the Setting
- The field should now show: **`web`**
- You should see a green checkmark or success message

### Step 6: Redeploy
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the **3 dots menu** (...) 
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"
6. Click **"Redeploy"**

## üîç What to Look For in Next Build:

After fixing, your build logs should show:
```
‚úÖ Cloning completed
‚úÖ Running "vercel build" 
‚úÖ Running from web directory
‚úÖ Installing from web/package.json  
‚úÖ Running "npm run build"
‚úÖ Next.js detected and building
‚úÖ Build completed successfully
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You Can't Find Root Directory Setting:

### Option A: Delete & Recreate Project
1. **Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Scroll to bottom**
2. **"Delete Project"**
3. **Create New Project**:
   - Import: `adarsh8081/adarsh_portfolio`
   - **Framework**: `Next.js`
   - **Root Directory**: `web` ‚Üê SET THIS!
   - Keep other defaults

### Option B: Contact Vercel Support
- The setting might be hidden in your plan
- Contact Vercel support for help

## üéØ THE KEY POINT:

**Root Directory MUST be set to `web`**

Without this setting, Vercel will ALWAYS try to build from the root directory, which will ALWAYS fail.
