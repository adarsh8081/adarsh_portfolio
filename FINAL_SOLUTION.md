# 🚀 FINAL SOLUTION: Delete & Recreate Vercel Project

## 🎯 Current Situation:
- ✅ Your code builds successfully (build logs show success)
- ✅ Next.js app compiles perfectly
- ❌ Still getting 404 because Vercel routing is wrong

## 📋 FINAL FIX - Delete & Recreate Project:

### Step 1: Delete Current Project
1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: `adarsh-portfolio-...` 
3. **Click on project** → **Settings** → **General**
4. **Scroll to bottom** → **"Delete Project"** (red button)
5. **Type project name** to confirm → **Delete**

### Step 2: Create New Project (CORRECTLY)
1. **Click**: "New Project" on dashboard
2. **Import**: `adarsh8081/adarsh_portfolio`
3. **CRITICAL SETTINGS**:

```
✅ Framework Preset: Next.js
✅ Root Directory: web          ← MOST IMPORTANT!
✅ Build Command: npm run build
✅ Output Directory: .next
✅ Install Command: npm install
```

4. **Click**: "Deploy"

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- Should take 2-3 minutes
- Build logs should show building from `web` directory
- Should end with successful deployment

## 🎯 Why This Will Work:

**Current Problem**: Vercel is building correctly but serving from wrong directory
**Solution**: Set Root Directory to `web` from the beginning

## ✅ Expected Result:

After recreation, your portfolio will load at the new URL showing:
- 🎨 Beautiful 3D hero section
- 📊 Your stats and projects
- 🎯 Full portfolio functionality

## 🔍 Alternative (If UI is Different):

If you can't find "Root Directory" during setup:
1. **After creating project** → **Settings** → **General**  
2. **Find "Build and Output Settings"**
3. **Set Root Directory**: `web`
4. **Redeploy**

---

**This is the guaranteed solution!** The issue is simply that Vercel doesn't know your app is in the `web` folder. Setting Root Directory to `web` fixes this completely.

🚀 **Your portfolio will be live after this fix!**
