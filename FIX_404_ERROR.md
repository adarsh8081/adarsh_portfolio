# 🔧 Fix 404 NOT_FOUND Error

## ✅ Good News: Your Site is Deployed!

Your site is live at: **https://adarsh-portfolio-sage.vercel.app**

But it's showing 404 NOT_FOUND because Vercel is not correctly configured to serve your Next.js app from the `web` directory.

## 🎯 Final Fix: Set Root Directory to `web`

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Project Settings
1. **Open**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click**: Your `adarsh_portfolio` project
3. **Click**: Settings (top menu)
4. **Click**: General (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Find and Update Root Directory
1. **Scroll down** to "Build and Output Settings"
2. **Look for**: "Root Directory" field
3. **Current value**: `.` (dot) or empty
4. **Change to**: `web`
5. **Click**: Save

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. **Go to**: Deployments tab
2. **Click**: Redeploy on latest deployment
3. **Uncheck**: "Use existing Build Cache"
4. **Click**: Redeploy

## 🔍 Alternative: Delete and Recreate

If you can't find the Root Directory setting:

1. **Delete Project**:
   - Settings → General → Scroll to bottom → Delete Project

2. **Create New Project**:
   - New Project → Import `adarsh8081/adarsh_portfolio`
   - **Framework**: Next.js
   - **Root Directory**: `web` ← MOST IMPORTANT!
   - **Build Command**: npm run build
   - **Output Directory**: .next
   - **Install Command**: npm install

## ✅ After Fixing:

Your site should load properly showing:
- ✅ Your portfolio homepage
- ✅ 3D hero section
- ✅ Featured projects
- ✅ All navigation working

## 🎯 Why This Fixes It:

Currently Vercel thinks your app is in the root directory, but your Next.js app is actually in the `web` subdirectory. Setting Root Directory to `web` tells Vercel to serve from the correct location.

**The fix is literally just: Root Directory = `web`**
